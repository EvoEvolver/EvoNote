# Interface of continuous and discrete

## Heap attack

### Paradox of the heap

::: tip Story
If you remove one grain of sand from a heap of sand, it is still a heap. If you keep removing grains of sand, eventually you will have only one grain of sand left. Is it still a heap?
:::

The key point of this paradox lies in the continuous nature of the concept - `heap`. The concept `heap`, is actually never well-defined when we use it as natural language. It also does not have a formal definition in any way. You knowledge about the heap might vary infinitesimally. For a same object, you might think that is a heap today and not a heap tomorrow.  

### Attack to any continuous concept

For any continuous concept that does not have a clear definition. You can always attack it by the following way:

::: tip Protocol
- Find an object that is an instance of the concept. 
- Find way to vary the object, so it is still an instance of the concept.
- Show that along the way, the object will eventually not be an instance of the concept.
- You know that along the way there must be a "sweet point". However, the sweet point should not exist because infinitesimal variation should not change the concept, even on the sweet point. Therefore, the concept is not well-defined.

For example, you can attack the concept `machine learning` by the following way:

::: tip Example
- Optimizing neural network on machines is an instance of `machine learning`.
- You can adjust the process by replacing some of the learning steps with human-made steps. It is still an instance of `machine learning`.
- You can adjust the process by replacing all the learning steps with human-made step except for one machine-made noise step. It is ridiculous if there are 100000 human-made steps and 1 useless machine-made step. However, it is still an instance of `machine learning`.

## Topology

Topology is an example where continuous entities can be unambiguously represented by discrete entities.

Condense matter physics loves topology very much. Part of the reason is the topological properties of condensed matter system nearly the only way to describe them in a discrete way.
