# Comment on previous philosophical works

My comments are mainly made on the following paper:

What is Understanding? An Overview of Recent Debates in Epistemology and Philosophy of Science: https://philpapers.org/rec/BAUWIU

## A decisive question

My decisive question to philosophers: Is Pavlov's dog and Russell's chicken understand bell and the coming of the farmer?

My answer: yes! They understand to the extend that they can draw and context. We should not require the context to be always true. Even human believe mythology.

My observation: Most of the philosophers do not agree with me according to the reference. 

## Chapter-wise comments

4.1 Understanding and the facts

My comment: factivity, to any extend, is not related to understanding. Understanding can easily be totally wrong. Mythology is a good example.

4.2.2. Grasping

My comment: It seems like the philosophers care about knowing the causality and thinks this might be a standard of understanding. In my view, causality is just a piece of knowledge. People usually forming an implicit context with it does not make it a necessary piece of understanding.
