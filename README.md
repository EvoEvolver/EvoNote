## Why knowledge base?

Because **non-parametric** knowledge is the **last piece** towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). We believe that large language model (parametric) + knowledge base (non-parametric) will finally make AGI possible. 

Characteristics of parametric knowledge:

- Fast and efficient
- Understanding and reasoning
- Hard to train & hard to forget
- Hallucination-prone (Like a **drunk person**)

Characteristics of non-parametric knowledge:

- Plug-and-play learning and forgetting
- Explainable and accurate
- Less efficient and dependent on parametric knowledge
- Not really understanding (Like a [**Chinese room**](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/))
